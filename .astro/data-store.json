The initial excitement is starting to fade, replaced by the creeping realization of the work ahead. 150 pounds feels like a distant dream.\n\n## A New Rhythm: Walk/Run Intervals\n\nYesterday afternoon, I decided to try something new: walk/run intervals. Just a short burst, about half a mile total, but enough to get my heart pumping. The idea was to ease myself into running without the jarring impact of a full-on jog. It wasn't pretty. My breath hitched, my legs burned, and my mind screamed for me to stop. But I pushed through, focusing on the small victories.

The data showed I burned 336 calories and my heart rate peaked at 183 bpm. Those numbers aren't just data points; they're proof of my effort, markers on the path towards my goal.\n\n## Small Victories, Big Picture\n\nThe scale hasn't moved much yet, but I know that real change happens gradually. I'm focusing on building healthy habits, one step (and one interval) at a time. Today's victory was simply completing the workout.

Just a short burst, about half a mile total, but enough to get my heart pumping. The idea was to ease myself into running without the jarring impact of a full-on jog. It wasn’t pretty. My breath hitched, my legs burned, and my mind screamed for me to stop. But I pushed through, focusing on the small victories. Each completed interval, each deep breath, each step forward, felt like a win.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” - Steve Jobs\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>While I wouldn’t say I \u003Cem>loved\u003C/em> those 30 minutes of exertion, I did appreciate the challenge.
