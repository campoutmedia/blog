It's March 4th, 2025, and the journey has just begun. The initial excitement is starting to fade, replaced by the creeping realization of the work ahead. 150 pounds feels like a distant dream.\n\n## A New Rhythm: Walk/Run Intervals\n\nYesterday afternoon, I decided to try something new: walk/run intervals. Just a short burst, about half a mile total, but enough to get my heart pumping. The idea was to ease myself into running without the jarring impact of a full-on jog. It wasn't pretty. My breath hitched, my legs burned, and my mind screamed for me to stop. But I pushed through, focusing on the small victories.

The data showed I burned 336 calories and my heart rate peaked at 183 bpm. Those numbers aren't just data points; they're proof of my effort, markers on the path towards my goal.\n\n## Small Victories, Big Picture\n\nThe scale hasn't moved much yet, but I know that real change happens gradually. I'm focusing on building healthy habits, one step (and one interval) at a time. Today's victory was simply completing the workout.

It’s March 4th, 2025, and the journey has just begun. The initial excitement is starting to fade, replaced by the creeping realization of the work ahead. 150 pounds feels like a distant dream.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-new-rhythm-walkrun-intervals\">A New Rhythm: Walk/Run Intervals\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Yesterday afternoon, I decided to try something new: walk/run intervals. Just a short burst, about half a mile total, but enough to get my heart pumping. The idea was to ease myself into running without the jarring impact of a full-on jog. It wasn’t pretty. My breath hitched, my legs burned, and my mind screamed for me to stop. But I pushed through, focusing on the small victories. Each completed interval, each deep breath, each step forward, felt like a win.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” - Steve Jobs\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>While I wouldn’t say I \u003Cem>loved\u003C/em> those 30 minutes of exertion, I did appreciate the challenge. It reminded me that this journey isn’t about instant gratification, but about building endurance, both physically and mentally. The data showed I burned 336 calories and my heart rate peaked at 183 bpm. Those numbers aren’t just data points; they’re proof of my effort, markers on the path towards my goal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"small-victories-big-picture\">Small Victories, Big Picture\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The scale hasn’t moved much yet, but I know that real change happens gradually. I’m focusing on building healthy habits, one step (and one interval) at a time. Today’s victory was simply completing the workout. Tomorrow, I’ll strive to push a little harder, run a little longer, breathe a little easier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Starting Weight: 233 lbs\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Current Weight: 233 lbs\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Goal Weight: 150 lbs\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>This journey is about more than just losing weight; it’s about gaining strength, health, and confidence.
