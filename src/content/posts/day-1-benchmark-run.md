March 1st, 2025 - Day 1

# Benchmark Run and the Road to 150

Today marks the beginning of my weight loss journey. Stepping on the scale at 233lbs wasn't easy, but it was the wake-up call I needed. My goal is to reach 150lbs, and while the road ahead seems long, I'm determined to make it happen. This journey is about more than just the number on the scale; it's about reclaiming my health and feeling good in my own skin again.

## The First Run

I started my day with a benchmark run to assess my current fitness level. It wasn't pretty, but I pushed myself to complete 1.11 miles in 29 minutes and 13 seconds. My average heart rate was 124 bpm, peaking at 166 bpm. I felt every single one of those pounds as I ran, but I also felt a surge of accomplishment when I finished. 

* Distance: 1.11 miles
* Time: 29 minutes, 13 seconds
* Calories Burned: 218
* Average Heart Rate: 124 bpm
* Max Heart Rate: 166 bpm

## The Road Ahead

This is just the first step, and I know there will be challenges ahead. There will be days when I want to give up, days when I feel discouraged, and days when the scale doesn't move as much as I'd like. But I'm committed to this journey, and I'm going to document every step of the way.

This first run, this first day, is my single step. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm looking forward to sharing my progress with you all.
