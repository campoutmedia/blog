# Day 2: Finding My Stride

March 2nd, 2025 - My weight loss journey is officially in full swing! The scale still reads 233lbs, but I can feel the change beginning, a subtle shift in my mindset. Today was all about pushing myself a bit further than yesterday.

## Run to the Beat

This afternoon I hit the treadmill. It wasn't pretty, and my lungs definitely protested, but I managed to run 1.51 miles in just over an hour! I burned over 600 calories which felt fantastic. My average heart rate sat at 137 bpm, peaking at 173 bpm - a reminder that my body is working hard.

While I don't exactly _love_ running just yet, I appreciate the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment afterward. Even small victories like this are fueling my motivation.

## Evening Stroll

Later in the evening, I took a relaxing walk around Owasso. The cool air felt refreshing, and the gentle pace allowed me to reflect on my progress. It was a much-needed way to unwind after a day of work and exercise. I covered 3.13 miles, burning another 394 calories, which is always a good sign!

## Small Steps, Big Goals

Two days down, and I'm already noticing small changes in my energy levels and overall mood. I know this is just the beginning, but I'm proud of the effort I've put in so far. My ultimate goal of 150lbs still seems far away, but every run, every walk, every conscious choice is a step closer. Iâ€™m excited to see what tomorrow brings!
