Day 4\. 233 pounds. These numbers echo in my mind. It's March 4th, 2025, and the journey has just begun. The initial excitement is starting to fade, replaced by the creeping realization of the work ahead. 150 pounds feels like a distant dream.

## A New Rhythm: Walk/Run Intervals

Yesterday afternoon, I decided to try something new: walk/run intervals. Just a short burst, about half a mile total, but enough to get my heart pumping. The idea was to ease myself into running without the jarring impact of a full-on jog. It wasn't pretty. My breath hitched, my legs burned, and my mind screamed for me to stop. But I pushed through, focusing on the small victories. Each completed interval, each deep breath, each step forward, felt like a win.

While I wouldn't say I _loved_ those 30 minutes of exertion, I did appreciate the challenge. It reminded me that this journey isn't about instant gratification, but about building endurance, both physically and mentally. The data showed I burned 336 calories and my heart rate peaked at 183 bpm. Those numbers aren't just data points; they're proof of my effort, markers on the path towards my goal.

## Small Victories, Big Picture

The scale hasn't moved much yet, but I know that real change happens gradually. I'm focusing on building healthy habits, one step (and one interval) at a time. Today's victory was simply completing the workout. Tomorrow, I'll strive to push a little harder, run a little longer, breathe a little easier.

* Current Weight: 233 lbs

This journey is about more than just losing weight; it's about gaining strength, health, and confidence. And I'm taking it one day at a time.
