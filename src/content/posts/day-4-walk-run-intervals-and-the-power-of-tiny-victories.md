It's Day 4 of my weight loss journey, and the scale still reads 233lbs. While a part of me wants to see that number drop drastically already, I'm choosing to focus on the positive changes I _am_ making. 

## Finding My Stride

Yesterday's workout was a mix of walking and running intervals. I pushed myself, clocking in at just under a half mile and burning over 300 calories. My heart rate definitely spiked â€“ up to 183 at one point! But it felt good. It felt like progress.

## Small Wins, Big Impact

This journey is a marathon, not a sprint. I'm learning to appreciate the small victories: completing a workout, resisting a sugary snack, choosing water over soda. These seemingly insignificant choices add up over time. They build momentum and reinforce the positive habits I'm cultivating.

Each step I take, both literally and figuratively, is a step closer to my goal of 150lbs. I'm not discouraged by the scale not moving yet. Instead, I'm fueled by the knowledge that I'm actively working towards a healthier, happier me. 

## Looking Ahead

Today is a new day, full of new opportunities to make healthy choices. I'm committed to staying the course, and I'm excited to see what the coming days and weeks bring.
